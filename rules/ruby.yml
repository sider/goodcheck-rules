    Check if using the same version also in other files, e.g. `Dockerfile`, `.github/workflows/test.yml`, or `.circleci/config.yml` etc.

    - When there are no other files using the Ruby version.
    - When there are no problems even if using different Ruby versions.

    `Range#end` returns the end of the range, not the last value of the range.

    For example, `(0...4).end` will return `4` as well as `(0..4).end`.

    ```ruby
    (0..4).end          #=> 4
    (0...4).end         #=> 4
    (0..4).to_a.last    #=> 4
    (0...4).to_a.last   #=> 3
    ```

    If you want to get the last value of `(0...4)`, maybe `#end` is not suitable
    because it excludes the last value.

    See the reference for more details.

  justification:
    - When the receiver is not an instance of `Range`
    - When you really want to get the end of the range
