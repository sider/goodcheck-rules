  message: |
    Use `$default-branch` instead of a hard-coded default branch name such as `master`

    In the future, many repositories may no longer use `master` as the default branch name.
    See also the following announcement:
    https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-22-github-actions-better-support-for-alternative-default-branch-names/
  justification:
    - When this is not a branch name.
    - When this usage of the branch name is reasonable.
